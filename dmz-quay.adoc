= Begin by using rsync to copy the mirror-registry file from the DMZ-Bastion server to the DMZ_Quay server.

```bash
# cd /mnt/high-side-data
# tar -xzvf mirror-registry.tar.gz
image-archive.tar
execution-environment.tar
mirror-registry

```

* Trusting the mirror-registryâ€™s TLS certificate. Copy the Root Certificate Authority file (rootCA.pem) that the mirror-registry created in to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CA trust directory. Then run the update-ca-trust command.

```bash
# sudo cp -v $HOME/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
# sudo update-ca-trust
'/home/lab-user/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem' -> '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/rootCA.pem'
```
* Log in to the mirror-registry
* The username is init and the password discopass.


```bash
podman login -u init -p discopass $(hostname):8443
```

* The podman login command creates an authentication file / pull secret at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json, for example: /run/user/1001/containers/auth.json.

* NOTE:- The oc-mirror command looks for pull secrets in multiple locations:

* $HOME/.docker/config.json (created on the lowside jump system)

* $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json (created on the highside system)
